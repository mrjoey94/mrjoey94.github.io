                  <h3><b>Sven van de Wege, better known as BlindWarriorSven, was born on March 19th, 1986 in the Netherlands.</b></h3>
                  <p>At the age of 6, Sven was diagnosed with a brain tumor that destroyed his optic nerves, which left him entirely without sight. This was devestating for Sven because he loved computers and video games and he felt that, due to his blindness, he was unable to play them ever again. In October, 1993, Street Fighter 2 Turbo was released in Europe and Sven realized something: Despite not being able to see the screen, he was able to figure out what was happening in the game, using the sound effects. <br> This changed Sven's life forever as he slowly started learning how to play Video Games relying exclusively on sound.</p>
                  <p>These days, Sven is a professional video game player, creating content for platforms such as Twitch and YouTube, as well as pursuing the challenge of high-level competitive play in Street Fighter. He is also a public speaker and advocate for the disabled community, speaking at various events and conducting interviews with media outlets. Sven hopes that his story will inspire others to do something that they may not have thought possible.</p>
